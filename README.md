# Matrix_Manipulation (algorithms & data structures III)
Manipulation of a matrix (class) In order to practice the big five (algorithms & data structures III)

The Program creates and test a class called Matrix (a metrix of any dimantion) with a special attention to the "big five" (the destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor and move assignment operator.)

Matrix input is provided by the user, after which, all five functions are been tested in munipulating the matrix and returning results to the user. The process requires the overloading of << and [] operators as well.

make all - To compile all sections.

make clean - To remove all *.o and executable files.
